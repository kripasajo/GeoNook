### Team Members

### Project Description
[Geo Location Reminder is a web-based application designed to assist users in managing location-based tasks. The platform integrates an interactive map, where users can add, view, and manage tasks to be done. And the application provides a push notification for when a users current location is within a nearby radius of the location of the tasks.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Providing a solution to make commutes as effective as possible without the traveller forgetting tasks as they make their daily commutes]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[I made an application that sends notifications to the users when they reach the nearby radius of the tasks. So the user is reminded of the task.]
